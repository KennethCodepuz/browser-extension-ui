# Browser Extension Ui from frontend mentor

-I started this project in order to practice handling json data and get comfortable in using states in react
-I didn't use grid as I wanted to practice flexbox more for this challenge
-It's a simple UI for browser extensions
-Extensions are stored in a local json file.

## Tools I used

-I used Vite + React
-Practice Css flexbox
-Practice responsive design
-Made the custom slider

## Challenges I faced

-I struggled with the useState and how to update and filter the active and inactive extensions.
-Happy that I made it worked and I finished the project.
